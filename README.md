# Sprite-Rendering
This is a demonstration of showing graphical sprites for Ascii programs, using text highlighting for graphics. The basic idea is each sprite is a 2d array of ints, then you use the drawSprite function which uses the data to draw the sprite to the screen. Not the best approach, but one I'm comfortable with.
